Project 7

In this final module, we'll employ machine learning (ML). At a high-level, there are three general categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We'll employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a best-fit straight line) to make predictions.

Python makes it easy! 

In this project, you'll see how we:

  - provide the data,
  - ask lingress() for the slope & y intercept - it'll figure out the "best fit" straight line through the data (y = mx + b)

Now we can ask:

  - for this x-value, what would be the y-value on that straight line? 

Chapters

  - Work through the book and examples from Chapter 10 refreshing especially your work on 10.16 on Time Series and Simple Linear Regression.
  - Read through the book and examples from Chapter 15 on Machine Learning, focusing on 15.4 Simple Linear Regression and Predictions.
